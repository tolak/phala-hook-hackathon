# An Off-chain Orderbook for Uniswap Pools

## Description

An Uniswap Pre-Swap Hook to provide the Orderbook funtionality for Uniswap pools. MEV protection guaranteed, no more Slipepage, no more trading fee, without necessity to swap inside AMM pool.

## Why it Matters

- People are struggling with the slipage, espaecally at poor liquidity pool
- People got sandwich attack even with a proper slipage tolerance setting
- Trading fee is expensive especially swap with high quantity

## Solution

Instead of swapping though pool directly, each time when traders submit their trading transaction, we will first look up the off-chain orderbook to check if there have counterpart orders. If have, we will swap between order provider and trader's request automatically on pre-swap hook contract, or we fallback to AMM pool.
- [Hook contract](./contracts/src/OrderBook.sol)
- [Orderbook Utilities](./scripts/console.js)

## How it works

- We define people who trades on Uniswap as Traders, people who submit their order to off-chain orderbook as Order Providers

- An off-chain orderbook implemented in Phat Contract, in this Hackathon, we simulate with JavaScript, and an simple orderbook described and maintained manually in a [JSON file](./scripts/orderbook.json)

- Order provider submit their order though Phat contract query, which underlying being saved in phat contract's cache without any delay and fee required.

- When Trader swap in this pool, we check the orderbook to see if there are orders can match the trading requirement.
    - If exist, we construct the automatic swap transaction data (e.g. hook data below) and pass it to the pre-swap hook contract, inside the pre-swap hook function, we exchange assets for provider and traders with ERC20 `transferFrom` function, then return NoOp so the uniswap swap operation will be skipped; For example, with the following command, we calculated the hook data that can be specificed when doing swap  on the UI
    ```sh
    node scripts/console.js orderbook search --spender 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 --spend token0 --amount 100

    ```

    then we pass the hook data to swap function:

    ![swap with off-chain order](./img/swap.png)

    - If not exist, we pass empty argument to pre-swap hook function, thus, nothing will happen in the pre-swap hook, which eventually will fallback to the uniswap swap function, traders get their token from on-chain pool.
